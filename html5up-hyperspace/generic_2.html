							<h2> Store</h2>
							<p>Have you noticed that when we are shopping at a chain store, the consultant of that store will inquire you to join the membership free with a card and encourage you to use it every time you shop there? The use of the loyalty card is for not only rewarding repeat customers and incentivizes more shopping, but also for tracing and storing users’ purchase data, which allow them to build detailed customer profile. So that they can use it to modified their product types and even can sell those data to the other companies, for example advertisers. </p>

In the other word, to check is the student copied the content from others without any references. </p>
